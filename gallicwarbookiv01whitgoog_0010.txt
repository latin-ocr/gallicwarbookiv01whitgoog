PREFACE.

Fon some long time past it has been widely felt
that a reduction in the costos Classical Works
used in schools generally, and more especially in
those intended for boys of the middle classes, is
at once desirable and not difficult of accomplish·
ment. For the most part only portions of authors
are read in the earlier stages of education, anda
pupil is taken from one work to another in each
successive half-year or terrm so that a book
needlessly large and proportionahly expensive is
laid aside aster a short and but partial use. ¹

In order, therefore, to meet what is certainly a
want, Portions of the Classical Writers usually
read in Schools are now being issued under the
title of GRAMMAR Scnoor Tuxrs3 while, at the
request of various Masters, it has been determined
to add to the series some portions of the Greek

, Testament.

Each ΤΕΧΤ is provided with a VOCABULARY ol
the words occurring init In‘ every instance—with
the exception of Eutropius and AEsop—the origin
of a word, when known, is stated at the commence-

nent of the article treating oi ht, 'rt eonneeten *einh
